**Database Analysis Project Using Python Data Frames â€“ Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab**

This was the third major data analytics project completed in the the first computer science course on the Data Analytics track during my junior year fall semester. Using Python learned from tutorials in Jupyter Notebook, my partner and I coded a data story in Google Colab to explore various questions surrounding Advanced Baseball Statistics from the 2021 MLB season. In this project, my partner and I built two dataframes, one corresponding to offensive and the other corresponding to defensive statistics. We then ran numerous comparative models to determine if advanced baseball statistics are a more accurate measure for offensive and defensive effectiveness compared to traditional statistics. This project helped me demonstrate my knowledge of Python while telling a data story given a small database we built on our own.

In this folder, the .ipynb file which tells the data story is included. The image below displays a preview of one of the visuals created. Additionally in this folder, there are two Tableau certifications: Tableau Fundamentals and Tableau Prep Builder Intermediate.
