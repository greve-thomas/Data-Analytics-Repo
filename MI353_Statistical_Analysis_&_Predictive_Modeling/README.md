**Data Mining Project â€“ SAS Enterprise Miner**

This was the another data analytics project completed during my spring semester junior year. Using SAS Enterprise Miner, we used data mining best practices on California real estate listings to conduct an analysis on the underlying symptoms of the California housing crisis. After cleaning up our large data set, we created decision trees, clusters, and linear regression outputs to better understand our data. The main goal of this analysis was to explore methods to clean and analyze large datasets. This project caused some significant problems, but taught persistence in trying to reach an end goal when using data to tell a story.

In this folder, the group presentation and writeup of the data mining process and analyses are included. Find below an image excerpt from the the cluster analysis conducted with SAS Enterprise Miner.
