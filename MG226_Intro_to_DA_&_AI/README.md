**Data Preparation and Visualization Project â€“ Tableau Prep and Tableau**

This was the second data analytics project completed in the second class on the Data Analytics track during my sophomore year spring semester. Using Tableau Prep and Tableau, I built a data story to explore various questions surrounding a dataset on the Top 500 Private United States Company (2014). Topics explored in this project include the locations of the top private companies, the growth of the top private companies by industry and region, employee revenue, workforce size, and many other unique insights that utilized a multitude of dashboard design features. This helped me learn how to tell a holistic and wholistic story given a very large dataset.

In this folder, the Tableau file including the data story is included. The image below displays a preview of one of the dashboards created. Additionally in this folder, there are two Tableau certifications: Tableau Fundamentals and Tableau Prep Builder Intermediate.
