**Machine Learning/AI Project Notebook - Microsoft SageMaker Studio Lab**

Using Microsoft SageMaker Studio Lab as the platform to host the Jupyter Notebook, we ran througha tutorial that demonstrated various ML/AI functions on a Titanic dataset. We used a training set to build our ML algorithm and then test it on the test set. Ultimately, the goal of this project was to see if we could train the model to accurately predict whether a Titanic passenger survived based on many characteristics.
