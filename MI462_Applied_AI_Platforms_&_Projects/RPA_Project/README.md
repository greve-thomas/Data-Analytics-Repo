**Robotic Processing Automation (RPA) Project - BluePrism**

This project involved creating an RPA solution to automatically input Order information from a dataset into a program. The solution would then extract order numbers and automatically insert it into a database. The solution drastically simplified a long and complicated process. Below is an image of the process solution.
