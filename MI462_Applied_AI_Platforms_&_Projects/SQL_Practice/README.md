**Database Management Tasks Using SQL â€“ Databricks**

For this project, I used Databricks as the host platform for Jupyter Notebook. Using SQL, I conducted some joins on two datasets that we obtained during class and conducted data governance best practices with. Included within this folder are the two datasets as .csv files. They were joined in the .html SQL file on a common column. 

Also included in this dataset are my certificates for completing the Databricks Lakehouse Fundamental courses.
