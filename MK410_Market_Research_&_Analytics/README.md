**Marketing Data Analytics Project for Non-Profits â€“ SPSS**

This was the a smaller data analytics project completed in my capstone Marketing classes during my junior year. Using SPSS, I conducted descriptive analytics on survey data on consumer surveys for various organizations. In the first class during the fall semester, we analyzed survey data for Special Olympics athletes and spectators at the 2021 Eastern Fall Sectional Long Distance Running Event. In the second class during the spring semester, we analyzed survey data for Girls on the Run athletes from the Fall 2021 Celebration 5k. The main goal of this analysis was to determine methods to improve participant and spectator satisfaction at these school sanctioned events. These projects provided real-world experience with non-profit organizations who needed assistance with fulfilling specific data needs.

In this folder, both group presentations are included. Find below an image excerpt from the tests conducted on SPSS for the Special Olympics project.
