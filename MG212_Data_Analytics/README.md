**Data Analysis Project â€“ Excel & Minitab**:

This Data Analysis project was the first project completed as part of the Data Analytics track. Using Excel and Minitab to perform basic statistical summaries, this project involved collecting local county COVID-19 case statistics and compiling them to compare infection rates in different regions. My written analysis included insights into which areas were hit the hardest by the pandemic, highlighting local colleges and communities. This was my first exploration into Data Analytics projects, and provided very basic exploratory information. This project still helped build the foundation for learning how to initiate future projects.
