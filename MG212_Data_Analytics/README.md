**Data Analysis Project â€“ Excel & Minitab**:

This Data Analysis project was the first project completed in the first class on the Data Analytics track my sophomore year spring semester. Using Excel and Minitab to perform basic statistical summaries, this project involved collecting local county COVID-19 case statistics and compiling them to compare infection rates in different regions. My written analysis included insights into which areas were hit the hardest by the pandemic, highlighting local colleges and communities. This was my first exploration into Data Analytics projects, and provided very basic exploratory information. This project still helped build the foundation for learning how to initiate future projects.

Included in this folder are the links to the datasets that were used. The first file is the Minitab file, the second file is the raw data in .csv format, and the final file is the associated project writeup. Screenshots of the results from the ANOVA test and Tukey Comparison are also included in the project writeup document, as pictured below.
